# FSUDash-LeachLevel-Design
In my CEN4020L capstone course, our group decided to develop a game using the PyArcade tutorial. We decided to use Tiled for designing each level.

# Creating the tilemap using AI
My level was located at The Leach, the main gym at FSU. I worked with AI to create a tiled-map based on images of the Leach I feed it. I also instructed it to create the image as a 2d background. The is when I got "gym.png". This was my base, using tiles from this image to create the leach level. I also created "tileset.png", which was a tilemap of gym equipment.

# Designing my Level
  # Creating Tilesets
  Once I got my base image I wanted to use tiles from, then I create the actual tile map I would implement in PyAracde. I used "gym.png" to create "leach.tsx", this is the map I would take tiles from to create my level. Additionally, from "tileset.png" I created tileset.tsx. These files were the tilesets I would use.
